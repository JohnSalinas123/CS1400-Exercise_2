# CS1400-Exercise_2
a set of 4 exercises from CS1400, to practice coding in java

## Exercise 2-1: Running Min/Max
Write a program that lets the user enter a series of integers.  As the program runs, it keeps track ofthe largest and smallest values entered.  When -99 is entered, this is a signal to stop the program: Atthis point, the program will print the largest and the smallest of the input values (ignoring the -99),then the program will terminate.

## Exercise 2-2: Bookstore
A bookstore has a book club that awards points to its customers based on the number of bookspurchased each month.  There is a paid version of the membership and a free version.If a customer purchases:0 books, they earn 0 points 1 book, they earn 5 points 2 books, they earn 15 points3 books:If they are a paid member, 50 pointsIf they are a free member, 30 points4 or more books:If they are a paid member, 100 pointsIf they are a free member, 60 pointsWrite a program that asks the user how many books they bought this month as well as if they are apaid member or not.  The program should then display how many points they received this month.

## Exercise 2-3: Distance from Point to Line
Write a program that asks the user to enter two points that lie on a line (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and athird point (x0, y0).  The program will print the distance from the point to the line.  So the programasks the user to enter the values x1, y1, x2, y2, x0, and y0.
Recall that the formula for computing the distance from a point to a line is: (Distance Formula)

## Exercise 2-4: Intersection of Two Lines
Write a program that asks the user to enter two lines.  The first line is given as the two points (x1, y1)and (x2, y2), and the second line is given as the points (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).  So the program will askthe user to enter these 8 coordinates.  The program will then print the coordinates of the point wherethe lines intersect.  However, if the lines are parallel or if they are coincident (the same line), theprogram will print "parallel lines". 
Recall that the point of intersection can be computed as follows: (Equations shown in exercise pdf)
